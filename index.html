<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<p>Straight to the Point Archery is a non-profit archery education center
  founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen.  Our state of the art educational and training
  facility incorporates detailed technical video analysis combined with
  generations of archery experience from certified coaches and instructors.<p>

  <p>Straight to the Point Archery is an indoor training facility with  28 shooting
 (14 - 10 yard lanes and 14 â€“ 20 yard lanes) and 2 private coaching rooms.
 We also have access to 26  additional  20 yard lanes  and an outdoor shooting
 field.  We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone from the first
 time archer to the professional archer. Once set up with proper fitting
 equipment, each archer will be given the basic safety instruction to start and
 will be introduced to various shooting techniques.</p>

 <p>From Beginner to Elite, archers of all ages and ability learn about this
 exciting Olympic and international sport. Sign up for a group lesson, private
 class, schedule a birthday or corporate party or compete at one of our many
 tournaments.  Straight to the Point Archery also offers homeschooling programs,
 kids club events, YMCA classes, Boy and Girl Scouts achievement programs and
 several other youth group activities. We are dedicated to teaching valuable life
 skills to the youth in our community through the wonderful discipline of
 archery.</p>
